Applies a patch from a local or remote file to any package that is part of a given composer 
project. Patches can be defined both on project and on package level in package config or 
separate JSON file. Declaration-free mode (using embedded info within patch files) is available as well.

The way the patches are applied (the commands, pre-checks) by the plugin is fully configurable (including the 
actual commands that are executed to apply the patch) from the composer.json of the project.

Note that the plugin is kept on very old PHP version as legacy software is usually the most common context
where patches are needed.

## Quick Start

Composer packages can be targeted with patches in two ways: 

* Embedded metadata (recommended default approach)
* JSON declaration and embedded (recommended for remote patches)

### Usage: Embedded Metadata

```json
{
  "require": {
    "some/package-name": "1.2.3"
  },
  "extra": {
    "patcher": {
      "search": "patches"
    }
  }
}
```

Contents of patches/changes.patch:

```diff
This patch changes... 
absolutely everything

@package some/package-name

--- Models/Example.php.org
+++ Models/Example.php
@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@
      */
     protected function someFunction($someArg)
     {
-        $var1 = 123;
+        $var1 = 456; // patched by composer-patches
         /**
          * rest of the logic of the function
          */
```
As a good practice you might want to add a hint, that the file was patched.

Full list of tag options (that cover all features of the plugin can be found [HERE](./docs/USAGE_BASIC.md#embedded-metadata)).

Note that tags cover most of the features of the module so every explanation given for the json
declaration of the patches applies for tags as well.

### Usage: JSON Declaration

```json
{
  "require": {
    "some/package-name": "1.2.3"
  },
  "extra": {
    "patches": {
      "some/package-name": {
        "This patch changes ... absolutely everything": "patches/changes.patch",
        "remote patch": "http://www.example.com/remote-patch.patch",
        "remote patch with checksum check": {
          "source": "http://www.example.com/other-patch.patch",
          "sha1": "5a52eeee822c068ea19f0f56c7518d8a05aef16e"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

     protected function someFunction($someArg)
     {

         /**
          * rest of the logic of the function
          */
```

### Applier Configuration

The way patches are applied can be manipulated by changing the configuration of the patcher or by introducing
additional patch appliers.

In most cases there should not be much of a need to reconfigure the module as it does ship with reasonable
defaults. The appliers supported by default: patch, git.

More information on said topic can be found [HERE](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Upgrades

When upgrading the module, one might encounter odd crashes about classes not being found or class 
constructor arguments being wrong. 

This usually means that the class structure or constructor footprint in some of the classes have changed 
after the upgrade which means that the plugin might be running with some classes from the old and some 
classes from the new version. 

Due to the fact that the patcher kicks in very late in the process of installing a project (before 
auto-loader generation), developers are advised to re-execute `composer install`.

Ideally, plugins should always be updated with explicit `--no-plugins` flag added to the `composer update`
call to avoid issues that plugin usage with potentially mixed logic from two different plugin releases
being in use.
